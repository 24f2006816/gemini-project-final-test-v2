# Gemini Project End-to-End Test Application

This single-file web application serves as a simple front-end for triggering and viewing simulated end-to-end test results for a deployed Gemini project. It's designed to provide a quick interface for a 'final end-to-end test' scenario, offering a clear visual status of test execution.

## Features

*   **Simple User Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface for triggering tests.
*   **Project ID Input:** Optional field to specify a project ID for context.
*   **Simulated Test Execution:** Mimics an asynchronous test run with a loading indicator.
*   **Dynamic Results Display:** Shows simulated test outcomes (Success, Failed, Error) in a readable JSON format.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
*   **Single-File Deployment:** Everything (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is self-contained in one `index.html` file, making it easy to deploy or share.

## How to Run

This application is a static HTML file and does not require any build tools or server-side setup.

1.  **Save the file:** Save the content of `index.html` into a file named `index.html` on your local machine.
2.  **Open in browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it with your preferred web browser.

That's it! The application will load directly in your browser.

## Usage

1.  **Enter Project ID (Optional):** You can enter a project identifier in the input field to simulate testing a specific project.
2.  **Click 'Run End-to-End Test':** Click the button to initiate a simulated test run.
3.  **View Results:** After a brief simulated delay, the test results will appear below the button, indicating the status (SUCCESS, FAILED, or ERROR) along with a summary or error details.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the page structure.
*   **Tailwind CSS (CDN):** For utility-first styling and responsiveness.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla):** For all interactive logic and DOM manipulation.
